These templates are aligned with the Architecture Decision Record (ADR) structure in this repository and emphasize:

- Explicit decision drivers
- Clear trade-offs

Documentation in this repository is intentionally:

- Lightweight but rigorous
- Security-aware
- Trade-off explicit
- Revisit-able as constraints evolve
- Focused on delivery, not bureaucracy

The objective is architectural clarity — not documentation volume.
