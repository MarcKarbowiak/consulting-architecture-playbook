# Architecture Diagrams

This folder contains visual representations of system architectures referenced in the case studies.

Diagrams are intentionally high-level and focus on:

- System boundaries
- Major components
- Data flow
- Integration points
- Separation of concerns

## Diagram Philosophy

In consultancy environments, diagrams should:

- Clarify, not overwhelm
- Highlight critical architectural decisions
- Support stakeholder discussions
- Be understandable by both technical and non-technical audiences

Diagrams are typically created at multiple levels:

1. **Context Diagram** – External systems and high-level interactions
2. **Container Diagram** – Major application components
3. **Data Flow Diagram** – Movement of information through the system

## Tools

Diagrams may be created using tools such as:

- Excalidraw
- Lucidchart
- Draw.io
- Miro

The emphasis is on clarity and decision communication rather than visual perfection.

Each diagram should correspond to a case study and help reinforce the documented architectural reasoning.
