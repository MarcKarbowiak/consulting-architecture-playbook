# Consulting Architecture Playbook

A living reference repository of architecture decision records (ADRs), system design case studies, and reusable delivery templates.

This repository serves two purposes:

1. A structured lookup system for future consulting, architecture, and delivery work  
2. A transparent demonstration of consulting-grade technical thinking  

It is designed to support disciplined, pragmatic system design across SaaS, enterprise modernization, distributed systems, and AI-enabled platforms.

## Why This Repository Exists

In consulting and technical leadership roles, speed and clarity matter.

Rather than reinventing patterns for every engagement, this repository provides:

- Reusable architectural reasoning
- Documented trade-offs
- Structured design templates
- Failure-mode thinking
- Security-aware design principles
- Scaling and evolution strategies

It acts as both:

- A personal architecture knowledge base  
- A reusable toolkit for client-facing delivery

## Repository Structure

### 1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

Documented architectural decisions including:

- Managed platform vs Kubernetes
- Document database vs relational database
- Tenant isolation strategies
- Modular monolith vs microservices

Each ADR includes:
- Context and constraints
- Decision drivers
- Alternatives considered
- Security implications
- Trade-offs and consequences
- Revisit criteria

These are reference decisions that can be adapted to new engagements.

---

### 2. System Design Case Studies

Anonymized real-world examples demonstrating:

- Multi-tenant SaaS architecture
- AI-enabled RAG system design
- Distributed synchronization reliability engineering
- Offline-first mobile system design

Each case study follows a consistent structure:

- Business context and constraints
- Architecture overview
- Data modeling strategy
- Failure modes and mitigations
- Security and operational considerations
- Scaling and future evolution

These are not marketing artifacts — they are architectural narratives.

---

### 3. Consulting Templates

Reusable structured documentation for:

- Architecture Decision Records
- Technical Design Documents
- Discovery Workshops

These templates are intended for active use in future projects and engagements.

---

## Architectural Philosophy

This repository reflects a practical design philosophy:

- Prefer clarity over complexity
- Make trade-offs explicit
- Embed security into design decisions
- Start simple, scale deliberately
- Document decisions that matter
- Treat failure modes as first-class concerns

The objective is sustainable, production-grade systems — not novelty.

## How to Use This Repository

As a lookup system:

- Use ADRs to evaluate infrastructure and platform decisions
- Use case studies to guide similar architectural scenarios
- Use templates to accelerate structured documentation
- Adapt patterns, don’t copy blindly

As a portfolio:

- Review architectural reasoning
- Assess decision rigor
- Evaluate trade-off discipline
