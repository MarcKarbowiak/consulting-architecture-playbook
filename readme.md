# Consulting Architecture Playbook

A curated collection of architecture decision records (ADRs), real-world system design case studies, and reusable technical templates demonstrating consulting-grade technical leadership.

This repository reflects how I approach designing scalable, secure, and maintainable SaaS systems in boutique consultancy environments.

## Purpose

Modern consultancies need engineers who can:

- Translate ambiguous business requirements into clear system designs
- Make pragmatic architectural trade-offs
- Ship production-ready systems with delivery discipline
- Communicate technical decisions clearly to clients and stakeholders

This repo showcases that approach.

## What You’ll Find Here

### 1. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
Clear documentation of trade-offs such as:

- App Services + Functions vs Kubernetes
- Cosmos DB vs Relational databases
- Multi-tenant partitioning strategies
- Modular monolith vs microservices

Each ADR documents:
- Context and constraints
- Decision and rationale
- Trade-offs and alternatives
- When the decision would change


### 2. System Design Case Studies
Real-world architecture examples including:

- Multi-tenant SaaS on Azure
- AI-enabled RAG platform design
- Distributed system modernization

Each case study includes:
- High-level architecture overview
- Key design constraints
- Data modeling decisions
- Failure modes and mitigations
- Scaling considerations


### 3. Consulting Templates
Reusable documentation patterns for:

- Architecture Decision Records
- Technical Design Documents
- Discovery Workshops
- Feature Rollout Plans

Designed to accelerate delivery while maintaining architectural clarity.

## Architectural Philosophy

I prioritize:

- Pragmatic architecture over novelty
- Modular systems with clear boundaries
- Secure-by-design cloud infrastructure
- Delivery velocity with quality guardrails
- Explicit trade-off documentation
- Observability and operational clarity from day one

The goal is not theoretical perfection — it is sustainable, production-grade systems delivered with confidence.

## Intended Audience

- Engineering leaders in boutique consultancies
- Architects evaluating system trade-offs
- Teams modernizing legacy platforms
- Product stakeholders seeking architectural clarity
