# System Design Case Studies

This folder contains anonymized case studies demonstrating consulting-grade architecture, modernization, and distributed systems engineering across multiple domains.

Each case study follows a consistent structure:

1. Executive Summary  
2. Business Context & Constraints  
3. High-Level Architecture  
4. Data Modeling Strategy  
5. Key Architectural Decisions  
6. Failure Modes & Mitigations  
7. Security & Operational Considerations  
8. Scaling & Future Evolution  
9. Outcomes / Lessons Learned
