# System Design Case Studies

This repository contains anonymized architectural case studies demonstrating hands-on system design, modernization, and AI-enabled platform engineering across multiple domains.

These examples reflect two recurring themes in my work:

- Establishing durable foundations in new systems (greenfield architecture)
- Modernizing legacy workflows to create stable platforms for future evolution

The emphasis is on clarity of thinking, explicit trade-offs, and pragmatic execution — not product marketing.

## Engineering Philosophy

- Make failure modes explicit.
- Prefer simplicity over novelty under delivery pressure.
- Establish data and tenant boundaries early.
- Treat AI outputs as probabilistic and testable.
- Use managed services pragmatically when team size is constrained.
- Design systems to evolve without requiring early over‑engineering.

## Case Study Structure

Each case study follows a consistent format:

1. Executive Summary  
2. Business Context & Constraints  
3. My Role & Scope  
4. High-Level Architecture  
5. Data Modeling Strategy  
6. Key Architectural Decisions & Trade-offs  
7. Failure Modes & Mitigations  
8. Security & Operational Considerations  
9. What I Would Refine Today  
10. Outcomes / Lessons Learned

## Portfolio Coverage

These case studies collectively demonstrate experience across:

- AI-enabled multi-tenant SaaS systems
- Enterprise workflow modernization
- Distributed synchronization and reliability engineering
- Offline-first mobile system design

Recurring architectural patterns include:

- Explicit state modeling for reliability
- Idempotent processing and safe retries
- Tenant isolation via partitioning discipline
- Incremental rollout through CI/CD
- Regression validation for AI-enabled systems
- Managed-service-first decisions in small teams

## Engagement Fit

These examples are representative of the roles I typically play inside client or product teams:

- Clarifying architectural direction under real constraints
- Translating business ambiguity into implementable system boundaries
- Implementing core components hands-on
- Establishing delivery discipline without introducing unnecessary process

The goal is to demonstrate engineering judgment and execution capability suitable for embedding directly inside product or consulting teams.
