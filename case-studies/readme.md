# System Design Case Studies

This folder contains real-world architecture case studies demonstrating how complex systems are designed, evaluated, and delivered in consultancy environments.

Each case study emphasizes:

- Business and technical constraints
- Architectural reasoning
- Data modeling decisions
- Failure modes and mitigations
- Scalability considerations
- Trade-offs between speed, cost, and maintainability

## Purpose

In boutique digital consultancies, clients rarely need theoretical perfection — they need pragmatic, defensible architecture aligned with business outcomes.

These case studies illustrate how to:

- Translate ambiguous requirements into system boundaries
- Make clear trade-offs under uncertainty
- Avoid over-engineering
- Design for evolution rather than premature complexity
